# ProjectCurrencyConverter
This project is an Angular-based single-page application (SPA) for converting currencies between Euro (EUR) and US Dollar (USD). It showcases the use of Angular 18's standalone components to create a modular, maintainable, and efficient application. The application includes features such as real-time exchange rate updates, custom rate input, and conversion history tracking.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.1.4.

# Key Points

- Git Clone: The `git clone -b develop` command ensures that you're cloning the specific `develop` branch of the repository.
- npm install: This command installs all necessary packages defined in the `package.json` file.
- ng serve: This command starts the development server and serves the Angular application, allowing you to access it via your web browser.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
